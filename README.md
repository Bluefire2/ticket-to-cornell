This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup information
Setting this project up is very simple on any system that supports [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), since it is compiled using [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/).

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into the root directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all of the required modules. *Make sure to run it in the root directory!*
3. Run `npm run start`, again in the root directory, and the game will run in your default browser.
